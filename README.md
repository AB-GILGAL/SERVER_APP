# SERVER_APP
This is a simple server built from scratch to manager the users of the server.
The server is able to receive requests and respond to the requests made to it.
This server has only two functionalities(a GET and a POST functionalities).
This means that you can only retrieve or view all already existing user information and also add a new user to the database.
You are not allowed to alter (PATCH, PUT, DELETE, ETC.) an already existing user information.
The server listens or runs on the port number 8000.
